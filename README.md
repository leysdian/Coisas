In this work it is possible to obtain power semiconductors devices from these codes and a ready-made database:

1 - In the "Parametros" code you must enter all the necessary parameters.
2 - In the "Formas de onda" code, you must load all waveforms in csv saved in the emulation or simulation.
3 - Therefore, total losses are calculated separately in each specific code for each device.
4 - In this way, the total losses of the devices can be obtained in the "P_totais" code and the best choice can be selected.
5 - Finally, figures can be created from the "Figuras" code.

Observation: You need to create a database of all power semiconductors devices separately to use in loss calculations.
